# Flavortown reviewers!

Hey there, Thanks for checking out my project! Since it's a Minecraft plugin to set it up you'll need a copy of Minecraft Java Edition and a Paper server (ver, 1.21+) with Geyser and Floodgate setup! You'll also need a copy of Minecraft Bedrock Edition to test the menus you've created.

## Downloads
- [Releases Tab](https://github.com/ISBP/BetterBedrockMenus/releases)
- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/better-bedrock-menus) [Currently still under review (2/22/26)]

## Info Video
Since setting up a server is a lot of work, I also provided a video that explains my project and provides a demonstration if you can't setup the plugin yourself.
